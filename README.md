# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code
 
 ## Description

 This website was built using starter code from UT's Bootcamp course as part of the Module 3 challenge. I edited the code so that the user could input info into a table using prompts on the screen. If a user tries to enter a value that does not equal zero in the "salary" prompt, the value will output as 0. The console logs a randomized "winner" to a drawing, and will average out the input salaries. This project was very challenging for me as it was my first time working with JavaScript, but I have learned a lot about how JS works. I look forward to becoming more proficient in JS in the future.
